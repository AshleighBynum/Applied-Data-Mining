      ** As an fake insurance company, we wanted to look at expanding Nationally, as we currently only operate in the Midwest.
      
      **Using data from fata automobile accidents from 2011, I used Exploratory Data Analysis and Unsupervised machine learning methods to find groups of crash victims.
      
      ** Understanding the groups of crashes/victims helps us identify the types of desireable customers/areas that we'd like to take on.
